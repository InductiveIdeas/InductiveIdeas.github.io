Project dependencies:
Foundation 6 framework
Vue.js
SCSS (compiled before upload with NPM)

Overview:
I created the website with the help of foundation framework to assist with a quick responsive design turn around.  A few custom media queries were used to account for unintended layout changes and a some mobile design changes. A quick vue.js instance was used to add simple product quantity count and price total. I also used SEO practices to set the page up for success on a future SEO optimization pass.

Production considerations:
I would optimize/minify JS and CSS manually or with webpack. I would also like to add much more user interactivity in line with image gallaries and CSS animations for interactions. More detailed browser testing would also be done to make sure and achieve a consistant experience across all users and browsers.

Mobile design thoughts:
I simplified the header by moving the contact information to the footer and placing the social media links under the logo.  The menu is simple and clear to use.  A hamburger menu was intentionally not used for simplicity, usability and the fact that the menu wasn't overly large.  Because it's an ecommerce site I placed the shopping cart, search and user profile icons in a fixed location so the user can have immediate access to the ecommerce features at all times.
